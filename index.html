	<p style="position: absolute; text-align: justify; left: 23%; top: 165px;"> Stranger Things was created by Matt and Ross Duffer, known professionally as the Duffer Brothers,
	who also serve as showrunners and head writers, as well as direct many of the episodes.The two had completed writing and producing their 2015 film Hidden, in which they had 
	tried to emulate the style of M. Night Shyamalan. However, due to changes at Warner Bros,its distributor,the film did not see a wide release and the Duffer Brothers were 
	unsure of their future.To their surprise, television producer Donald De Line approached them, impressed with Hidden's script,and offered them the
	opportunity to work on episodes of Wayward Pines alongside Shyamalan.</p>
